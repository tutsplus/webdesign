    	<p>Here's a story about a fox. A small fox, who lived with his mother and siblings under the wooden decking of a University Campus somewhere in the United States.</p>
		
		<p>One day, while Bushy was busying himself near the library, he heard a noise which sounded most unlike anything he'd heard before.</p>
	
		<p>It came from the direction of the student union and sounded like a high-pitched squealing - as though a baby was being polished.	He wasn't to know at the time, but this was the day Bushy first encountered Justin Bieber's music.</p>
		
		<p>Alarmed, he ran - but as he burst out into the glaring sunlight he was suddenly struck by... my God, are you actually reading this? I've just written four paragraphs about a baby fox listening to Justin Bieber, and you're still engrossed! I suppose if I continue writing you'll carry on regardless, so I may as well write anything I want. My left arm is made of custard.</p>
